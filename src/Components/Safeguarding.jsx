                <strong className='font-semibold'>Enhanced DBS Checks:</strong> Every member of our
                staff, volunteer, and anyone in regular contact with students undergoes an Enhanced
                Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. This ensures that only individuals with
                a clear background are involved in our programmes.

                <strong className='font-semibold'>Safeguarding Training:</strong> All staff and
                volunteers in contact with young people receive safeguarding training to at least
                Level 2. Our Child Protection Lead has completed Level 3 safeguarding training,
                equipping them with advanced knowledge and skills to handle complex safeguarding
                concerns.

                recruitment and training to daily interactions with students. We strive to create a
                culture of vigilance and responsiveness, ensuring that any potential issues are
                addressed promptly and effectively.
