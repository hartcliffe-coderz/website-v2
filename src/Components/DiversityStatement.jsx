                At <strong>Hartcliffe Coderz</strong>, diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the
                heart of our mission. We are committed to empowering young people in some of the
                most deprived areas of the UK through free and accessible coding training. Our credo
                is that everyone deserves access to opportunities, regardless of their background or
                postcode. We are particularly dedicated to enhancing social mobility, ensuring that
                young people from all socioeconomic backgrounds have the chance to succeed and
                thrive in the tech industry.

                We prioritise the safety and well-being of our students, staff, and volunteers,
                ensuring equal opportunities regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment,
                race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation. Our team proudly represents
                underrepresented groups in tech, including women, ethnic minorities, and the LGBTQ+
                community. By embracing neurodiversity and supporting mental well-being, we aim to
                create an inclusive environment where every young person feels valued and inspired
                to reach their full potential.
